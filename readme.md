## Design Patterns implemented in Typescript

This repo is for self-reference only. All content originates in the website -> https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/go

### 🟨 Abstract Factory

> Adds an abstraction over many other related objects that are created using other creational patterns.

### 🔌 Adapter

> An alternative interface over an existing interface.

### 🌉 Bridge

> The Bridge pattern is similar to the Adapter pattern except in the intent that you developed it.

### 🏗 Builder

> A creational pattern whose intent is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that you can use the same construction process to create different representations.

### ⛓ Chain of Responsibility

> Pass an object through a chain of successor handlers.

### 🎖 Command

> An abstraction between an object that invokes a command, and the object that performs it. Useful for UNDO/REDO/REPLAY.

### 🍡 Composite

> A structural pattern useful for hierarchical management.

### 🪞 Decorator

> Attach additional responsibilities to an object at runtime.

### 🏠 Facade

> An alternative or simplified interface over other interfaces.

### 🏭 Factory

> Abstraction between the creation of an object and where it is used.

### 🥏 Flyweight

> Share objects rather than creating thousands of near identical copies.

### 🧏‍♂️ Interpreter

> Convert information from one language to another.

### ➿ Iterator

> Traverse a collection of aggregates.

### 🎌 Mediator

> Objects communicate through a Mediator rather than directly with each other.

### ⏱ Memento

> Save a copy of state and for later retrieval. Useful for UNDO/REDO/LOAD/SAVE.

### 👀 Observer

> Manage a list of dependents and notifies them of any internal state changes.

### 🧑‍🍼 Prototype

> Good for when creating new objects requires more resources than you need of have available.

### 🧟 Proxy

> A class functioning as an interface to another class or object.

### ⭕ Singleton

> Blockquotes

> A class that can be instanced at any time, but after it is first instanced, any new instances will point to the original instance.

### 🔂 State

> Alter an objects' behavior by changing the handle of one of its methods to one of its subclasses dynamically to reflect its new internal state.

### 🥷 Strategy

> Similar to the State Pattern, except that the client passes in the algorithm that the context should then run.

### 🤖 Template Method

> An abstract class (template) that contains a method that is a series of instructions that are a combination of methods that can be overridden.

### 👽 Visitor

> Pass an object called a visitor to a hierarchy of objects and execute a method on them.
